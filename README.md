# ImGui_ubuntu_calculator

## Background 
For a few years I have been developing in C and obtaining a fair amount of engineering and business domain expertise. I'd really like to find a way to make something a bit more user friendly than the CLI tools I've been developing for years.

In order to get my feet wet with a C/C++ friendly, cross-platform, and "simple" GUI I did some research and settled on trying ImGui first.

## Repository Goals
The goals of this repo need to stay simple or I'll never get the project to where I want it to be. I want to make a simple calculator with a minimal set of buttons. Something like this.

For further information (for instance, an unofficial guide showing how to get started with Dear ImGui), please visit the [docs folder](https://github.com/meowFlute/ImGui_ubuntu_calculator/blob/main/docs) where you'll find a table of contents to writeups of each major step that I went through.
