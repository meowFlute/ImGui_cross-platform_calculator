# TABLE OF CONTENTS

To keep things organized I'm just going to keep a list of links here with a brief description of what is detailed in each markdown file. 
I'll list them in the chronological order that they were created in.

**NOTE**: Each section header below is just a link to view one of the markdown files listed in the [docs folder](https://github.com/meowFlute/ImGui_ubuntu_calculator/blob/main/docs) if that isn't where you are looking already

## [Dear ImGui Installation: INSTALL.md](https://github.com/meowFlute/ImGui_ubuntu_calculator/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md)

This section describes: 
- how I went about getting the Dear ImGui software
- selecting a platform and rendering backend 
- collecting the necessary dependencies 
- doing a test build from the Dear ImGui examples
- setting up my own repository with Git submodules
- Modifying the example Makefile to suit my purposes
