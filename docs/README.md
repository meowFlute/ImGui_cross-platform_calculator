To keep things organized I'm just going to keep a list of links here with a brief description of what is detailed in each markdown file. 
I'll list them in the chronological order that they were created in.

**NOTE**: Each section header below is just a link to view one of the markdown files listed in the [docs folder](https://github.com/meowFlute/ImGui_ubuntu_calculator/blob/main/docs) if that isn't where you are looking already
